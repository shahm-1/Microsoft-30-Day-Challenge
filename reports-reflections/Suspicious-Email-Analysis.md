## Investigation

Header analysis revealed multiple red flags indicative of a phishing attempt. The source IP (114[.]29[.]236[.]247) geolocates to Hong Kong (CTRY:HK), while the spoofed sender domain shows a Bulgarian country code (BG) - both inconsistent with our Scranton, PA-based supplier. The message ID contains emkei[.]cz, a known email spoofing service commonly used by threat actors. Additionally, the Reply-To address differs from the sender address, likely the attacker's relay email. All authentication checks (SPF, DMARC, DKIM) failed.

The email was automatically quarantined by our system before reaching the recipient. No user interaction occurred.

## Actions Taken

1. Confirmed email as phishing attempt
2. Reported incident to Microsoft
3. Deleted email from quarantine
4. Conducted tenant-wide scope check for similar sender/subject combinations - no additional instances found

## Recommendations

1. Conduct a targeted review of emails received by k***y[@]s***3[.]onmicrosoft[.]com to determine if this is an isolated incident or part of a broader targeting pattern. If multiple instances are identified, immediately review and strengthen email filtering policies.

2. Perform a vendor security audit to identify potential gaps or vulnerabilities within the supply chain that could be exploited for social engineering attacks.

3. Escalate findings to stakeholders for vendor review. If the audit identifies significant security gaps with the third-party paper supplier, leadership should assess the risk-benefit of continuing the relationship.

4. If this incident is determined to be part of a broader phishing campaign, re-conduct user awareness training with emphasis on vendor impersonation and urgency-based social engineering tactics.
