## 🎯 Purpose of This Challenge

- I learn best by doing  
- This portfolio is where I build systems, investigate behavior, harden environments, and turn complexity into clarity  
- It reflects how I approach security: calmly, structurally, and with long-term impact in mind  
- I am documenting this challenge to share what I learn with others who are curious about cybersecurity  
- This challenge demonstrates what a modern **cloud SOC analyst** actually does using real Microsoft security tools  
- All work is performed inside a dedicated lab environment  

Focus areas include:

- Investigating malicious behavior  
- Analyzing phishing emails  
- Threat hunting  
- Writing incident reports
