## 🎯 Purpose of This Challenge

- Learn cybersecurity by **doing**, not memorizing  
- Build real systems, generate real telemetry, and investigate real behavior  
- Share what I learn with others curious about cybersecurity  
- Demonstrate what a **modern cloud SOC analyst** actually does  
- Everything is performed inside a dedicated lab environment

## 📘 Project Overview

This repository documents a 30-day, hands-on Microsoft cloud SOC challenge focused on building, breaking, detecting, and investigating inside a real lab environment.

The purpose of this project is to document real SOC-style work, show how I learn cybersecurity through building and investigation, and share what I learn with others interested in cybersecurity.

This challenge is designed to demonstrate what a modern cloud SOC analyst actually does — working with real systems, real telemetry, and real investigation workflows rather than isolated labs.

Throughout this project, I am focused on:

- Learning by doing, not memorizing  
- Building real environments instead of only following walkthroughs  
- Working directly with telemetry, detection logic, and investigations  
- Intentionally developing SOC-level technical skills  
- Understanding how systems behave and how attacks unfold  

The work in this repository includes building a Microsoft-based SOC lab, onboarding security tooling, validating telemetry, performing threat hunts, analyzing phishing activity, investigating alerts, and producing incident-style reports.
