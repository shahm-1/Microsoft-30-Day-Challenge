# 30-Day Microsoft SOC Analyst Challenge
---

- I have always been the type of person that learns by doing.
- This portfolio is where I build systems, investigate behavior, harden environments, and turn complexity into clarity.
It reflects how I think about security: calmly, structurally, and with long-term impact in mind.
- I'm documenthing this challenge to share the knowledge I gain with others who are also curious about learning how Cybersecurity works.
- This challenge is meant to demonstrate what a modern cloud SOC analyst does using real Microsoft security tools.
- I will investigate malicious behaviour, phishing emails, hunt for threats and write incident reports-all within this lab environment.




And that’s intentional.

Why This One Is Different

In the real world, SOC analysts often don’t get hand-holding.
They’re expected to research, test, and figure things out—and that’s exactly the kind of mindset this challenge builds.





You’ll be asked to investigate alerts without detailed instructions



You’ll run simulations with only context, not copy/paste commands



You’ll write reports based on what you observed, not what I told you to see






2. Write a Clear Project Overview

In your main page, briefly explain:

What this challenge is

### Tools

- Microsoft Sentinel
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Defender for Office 365
- Entra ID
- Microsoft Azure
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework
- Oracle VirtualBox

### Skills Developed

- Set up Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Office 365, and Entra ID
- KQL Querying
- Investigating phishing, malware, and identity-based attacks
- Incident reports mapped to MITRE ATT&CK
- Practice detection and response workflows used in real SOCs

### Projects

- Built a Microsoft SOC lab from scratch



3. Organize Your Work by Day or Theme

Break your challenge into folders or sections:

One for KQL queries

One for screenshots or dashboards

One for phishing simulations

One for written reports or reflections

This makes it easy for others to navigate and shows you understand structure and documentation.

4. Reflect On What You Did and Learned

Each mini-project should include:


What the task was

What steps you took

What you discovered or learned

What you would do differently (if anything) in a real SOC

This shows critical thinking not just technical steps.

5. Include Screenshots or Visuals When It Makes Sense

Visuals make your work more believable and engaging.

Screenshots of dashboards, alerts, or policies are great just avoid uploading anything sensitive.

6. End With a Summary of Results

Close your project with:

What you can now do that you couldn’t before

What part of the challenge was most impactful


What areas you want to keep improving

Optional:

Add a simple “table of contents” to your README



Use bullet points, not paragraphs
