# 🛡️ 30-Day Microsoft SOC Analyst Challenge

> A hands-on challenge focused on building, breaking, detecting, and investigating inside a real Microsoft cloud SOC lab.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Challenge

- Learn cybersecurity by **doing**, not memorizing  
- Build real systems, generate real telemetry, and investigate real behavior  
- Share what I learn with others curious about cybersecurity  
- Demonstrate what a **modern cloud SOC analyst** actually does  
- Everything is performed inside a dedicated lab environment  

---

## 📘 Projects

This challenge documents a 30-day hands-on journey into:

- Cloud SOC operations  
- Microsoft security tooling  
- Detection and investigation workflows  
- Incident-style reporting  

Designed to simulate how a real SOC environment operates.

## 🧩 Mini Projects

These are the core hands-on projects being built and expanded throughout the challenge.

- ✅ **Current Lab Environment**  
  *Enterprise-style Microsoft SOC lab setup, logging, and telemetry foundation.*

- 🚧 **Suspicious Email Analysis** *(in progress)*  
  *Phishing investigation, header analysis, Defender triage, and reporting.*

- 🚧 **Investigating an Alert** *(in progress)*  
  *SOC-style alert triage, log correlation, and attack validation.*

- 🚧 **Full Investigation** *(in progress)*  
  *End-to-end incident workflow: scoping, timeline, evidence, MITRE mapping, and response.*

(Each project’s technical work, evidence, and reports are distributed across the folders below.)
