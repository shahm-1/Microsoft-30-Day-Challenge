# 🛡️ 30-Day Microsoft SOC Analyst Challenge

> A hands-on challenge focused on building, breaking, detecting, and investigating inside a real Microsoft cloud SOC lab.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Challenge

- Learn cybersecurity by **doing**, not memorizing  
- Build real systems, generate real telemetry, and investigate real behavior  
- Share what I learn with others curious about cybersecurity  
- Demonstrate what a **modern cloud SOC analyst** actually does  
- Everything is performed inside a dedicated lab environment  

**Focus areas:**
- 🕵️ Threat hunting  
- 📧 Phishing analysis  
- 🚨 Malicious behavior investigation  
- 📝 Incident reporting

## 📘 Project Overview

This challenge documents a 30-day hands-on journey into:

- Cloud SOC operations  
- Microsoft security tooling  
- Detection and investigation workflows  
- Incident-style reporting  

Designed to simulate how a real SOC environment operates.
